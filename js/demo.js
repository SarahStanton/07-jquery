//Using jQuery methods, add a musical note symbol â™« (entity &#9835) to both the beginning and end of every paragraph in the song section.


//Using a jQuery method, add a `<div>` around every line in the song. 
//This <div> should have a class of "out" if the line rhymes with with "out", 
//and a class of "ain" if the line rhymes with "rain".
//   HINT: This is tricky! Look carefully at the jQuery examples and String methods
//				 You'll need to use an if statement


//Using a jQuery method, remove the lines from the song that contain the word "sing"
//  HINT: Again, look carefully at the jQuery examples!
